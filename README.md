# 2022 Robot Code

The code for our 2022 robot.

## Tips for contributing
- Commits should be atomic (one big commit instead of a bunch of little commits) unless it's a small, necessary change. You don't need to commit every little edit, but you should seperate them logically.
- [Write descriptive commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/), and add a description if it needs more explanation
- Make sure your code follows the formatting and styleing of everything else, it keeps the code neat
- *Test before you commit*
- Add comments where comments are due, where something that needs to be explained further for others to understands
